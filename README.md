# karma-plotly-reporter (deprecated)

This project was superseded by 
[`karma-benchmark-json-reporter`](https://github.com/etpinard/karma-benchmark-json-reporter) 
and [`karma-benchmark-plotly-reporter`](https://github.com/etpinard/karma-benchmark-plotly-reporter) where
the JSON and plotly graphs outputs were split across two distinct reporters.
